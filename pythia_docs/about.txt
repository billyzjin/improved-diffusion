About Pythia
============

The Pythia HPC Cluster is designed for GPU-accelerated applications and is available to Booth researchers to run A.I., machine learning, or other computationally intensive tasks.

Currently, Pythia comprises 15 physical nodes with 8 GPUs each (120 GPUs in total).

.. The H100 nodes pgpu001-005 are fully dedicated to Prof. XY Han research team. We use the Slurm resource manager to schedule jobs as well as interactive access to GPU nodes. Users must be associated with a Slurm account and qos to run jobs on Pythia.

The Pythia Computing Cluster is supported by Booth IT. For general assistance, contact the Help Desk helpdesk@chicagobooth.edu. 
More technical inquiries can be directed to Research Support research.support@chicagobooth.edu. 
Make sure to start a new email thread for each new support request. 
It helps us to organize requests.
